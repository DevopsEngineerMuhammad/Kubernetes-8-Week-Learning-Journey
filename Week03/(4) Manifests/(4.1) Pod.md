### Troubleshooting Minikube
If you encounter an error while applying a command from the above list, it may indicate that Minikube has stopped. Follow these steps to resolve the issue

1. Check the Minikube status:
```sh
  minikube status
```

2. If Minikube is stopped, start it:
```sh
  minikube start
```

3. Verify the Minikube status again:
```sh
  minikube status
```

4. Once Minikube is running, reapply the command that caused the error

# Note
Once you've successfully completed the above commands, click on (4.1) pod.md and apply the manifest along with all related commands. Similarly, practice is required for the remaining manifests, which are already given in sequential order. After finishing these tasks, click on (5) Notes.md and review it before moving on to Week 04. Thanks!
