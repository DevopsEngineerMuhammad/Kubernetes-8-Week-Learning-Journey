```sh
vi podwithPorts.yml
```

```sh
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
 name: testpod5
spec:
 containers:
  - name: coo
    image: httpd
    ports:
     - containerPort: 80
```

```sh
kubectl apply -f podwithPorts.yml
```

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

```sh
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
In your case you will get the pod ip by applying the above command, then use it in the below curl command, but be remember after pod ip colon and port number must be write down.

```sh
curl 172.17.0.3:80
```

```sh
kubectl delete -f podwithPorts.yml
```

```sh
kubectl get pods
```
